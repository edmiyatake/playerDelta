# PlayerDelta

**PlayerDelta** started as a test between the homies — now it’s a data-driven battleground.

Input ten players, split them into two teams, and let the stats speak. Who’s the better team? Who’s the actual carry? PlayerDelta visualizes the difference — from ranks to clutch stats — all in a sleek, Valorant-inspired interface.

🎮 **Features**
- Simulated Valorant match loading screen
- Enter 10 players → auto-generate two teams
- Display agent, rank, KDA, win rate, and more
- “Delta Score” that shows who’s really pulling weight

📈 **Planned Features**
- Tracker.gg integration for real-time stats
- Agent synergy alerts and match predictions
- Save & share matchups with your team

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- React (custom CSS, no Tailwind)
- Mock data → live data via Tracker.gg (future)
- Optional backend for stat processing
